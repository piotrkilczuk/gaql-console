# gaql_console

I built this for my own benefit to see how far I can go in a half day having no understanding of REPLs, lexing and 
other concepts required to build this kind of tool.

It is a working proof of concept, however, limited in features.

What I'd like to introduce at some point:

* better autocomplete
* persistence options (like write JSON to disk)
* visualisation options (not just printing the result to screen but folding/unfolding etc.)
